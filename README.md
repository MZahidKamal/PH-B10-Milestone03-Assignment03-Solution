# PH-B10 Milestone 03: Assignment 03 Solution

This was the assignment for the 3rd milestone of the 10th batch of the Web Development course offered by Programming Hero. After HTML and CSS, Tailwind CSS was taught in this milestone, and this landing page was created using it. Along with Tailwind CSS, a few DaisyUI components were used as well. There are some mid-level complex grid tasks in it.

The page has been made responsive for all the breakpoints mentioned in Tailwind CSS, meaning it is responsive for all devices.

This will remain just as an assignment, and there are no plans to update it.
